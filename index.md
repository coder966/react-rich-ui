## React Rich UI

React UI framework with lots of built-in UI components (forms, data table, steps wizards, etc...).
It is based on Bootstrap, and does /NOT/ intend to provide every single component you might need -like other UI frameworks-,
but rather only provide implementations for the complex use-case components, and it does so with simple APIs.

## Why Use React Rich UI ?

- Declarative: Lots of functionalities you would normally implement yourself is available with declarative APIs.
- Tiny: 40kB (minified & gzipped).
- Performant: Built with performance in mind from the first release.
- Elegant: Components come with builtin styles.
- Customizable: You can override and add your own CSS.
