## Why Use React Rich UI ?

- Rich: We provide more than 15 different components.
- Simple: There is almost no learning curve required to use the components. You can get started in under a minute.
- Declarative: The API is as declarative as it can get. Everything is either JSX or config object.
- Tiny: 43kB (minified & gzipped).
- Performant: Built with performance in mind from the first release.
- Elegant: Components come with builtin styles.
- Customizable: You can override and add your own CSS.
